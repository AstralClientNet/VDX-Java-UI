[Changes]
[*] HUD Screen now has fully compatible with modified scoreboard sidebar from other resource packs.
[*] RTX options are now visible only if you are on your Windows 10 computer. I did it so that you
    wouldn't feel bad if you use your mobile device. :(
    > However, if you are on your Windows 10 computer, you must have a dedicated graphics card installed to use these options.
[*] Fixed the issue with "Add Server" button.
[*] Fixed visual bugs for main buttons (In Windows 10 with Render dragon).
[*] Every dropdown options are now replaced by simple toggles.
[*] For the most important thing: the text of Log errors at the top is no longer displayed if you have activated
    the Log options in Profile, because everything is fixed and optimized for testing with other Add-Ons/Resource Packs! ;D
